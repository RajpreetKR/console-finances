# Console Finances

## Description
This is a challenge I did for my bootcamp. I was tasked to create a console app that will analyse the data set I recieved in the starter files. I utalised the knowledge I had learn over the week as well as my own research to help me get to my final answer. In addition to this, I had been researching some good practices for JavaScript so I included an example of this in my answer.
